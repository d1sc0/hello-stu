This is a repost of the image and text I shared last year on instagram at the end of baby loss awareness week. After posting I had two people come and talk to me about recent experiences they had gone through, who seemed genuinely grateful that I shared (I don't often get this reaction to my social posts ðŸ˜‚).

I repost with the same sentiment. Baby loss is common and hard on all of those involved. It's important we talk about it and support each other, fighting to help improve bereavement care.

For those who I know personally I'm always happy to lend a listening ear if you just need someone to share with.
